# The Goal 🏆

## Today's goal is to get acquainted with JavaScript-based web programming by creating a simple chat application. 
## We'll use modern tools (Node.js, Web Sockets, etc.) and touch upon many different technologies.

## The objective is not to fully understand every line of code, but to understand server-client architecture 
## and to be inspired by how much can be created with so little code

## Available Scripts

- `npm run start` - Starts the development server
- `npm run deploy` - Deploys the project to your GitHub Pages
